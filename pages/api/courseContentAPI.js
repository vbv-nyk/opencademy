				World Of Physics
			</h1>
			<div style={{ fontSize: "20px" }}>
				There is a strong correlation between physics and mathematics, as math
				is an essential tool for understanding and describing the physical
				world. In fact, many of the fundamental principles of physics can be
				expressed mathematically, and much of the work in physics involves using
				math to solve problems and make predictions. In grade 11 physics,
				students will begin to see this correlation firsthand as they use math
				to analyze and understand physical phenomena. For example, they may use
				algebra and trigonometry to analyze the motion of objects under the
				influence of various forces, or use calculus to understand how physical
				quantities change over time. In addition to using math to analyze
				physical systems, students will also learn about the mathematical models
				that are used to describe physical phenomena. These models are based on
				the laws of physics and allow scientists to make predictions about how
				the world will behave in a given situation. Overall, the relationship
				between physics and math is a close one, and a strong foundation in math
				is essential for success in physics. By learning about the fundamental
				principles of physics and how they are expressed mathematically,
				students will be better equipped to understand and analyze the physical
				world.

				Physics and Mathematics

				Uses of Dimension
			</h1>
			In physics, dimensions are a way of describing the size and scope of
			physical phenomena. The most common dimensions are length, mass, and time,
			which are used to describe the size, weight, and duration of objects and
			events. In grade 11 physics, students will learn about the different
			dimensions and how they are used to describe the physical world. They will
			also learn about the International System of Units (SI), which is a
			standardized system of units that is used to measure physical quantities.
			In addition to measuring physical quantities, dimensions are also used to
			describe the behavior of physical systems. For example, students may learn
			about how the dimensions of an object can affect its motion or how the
			dimensions of a space can influence the behavior of particles within it.
			Overall, the study of dimensions is an important part of physics and is
			essential for understanding the size, scale, and behavior of physical
			phenomena. By learning about dimensions and how they are used to describe
			the physical world, students will be better equipped to analyze and
			understand the world around them.
			<h1 style={{ marginTop: "4rem", marginBottom: "2rem" }} id={3}>
				Vectors and Scalers
			</h1>
			In physics, vectors are quantities that have both magnitude and direction,
			while scalars are quantities that have only magnitude. Vectors are often
			represented by arrows, with the length of the arrow representing the
			magnitude and the direction the arrow is pointing representing the
			direction. Scalars, on the other hand, are just simple numerical values.
			In grade 11 physics, students will learn about vectors and scalars and how
			they are used to describe physical phenomena. They will also learn how to
			perform operations with vectors, such as adding and subtracting them, and
			how to use vectors to analyze the motion and behavior of physical systems.
			<h1 style={{ marginTop: "4rem", marginBottom: "2rem" }} id={3}>
				Distance and Displacement
			</h1>
			In physics, distance is a measure of how far apart two objects are, while
			displacement is a measure of how far an object has moved from its starting
			point. Distance is a scalar quantity, meaning it has only magnitude and no
			direction, while displacement is a vector quantity, meaning it has both
			magnitude and direction. In grade 11 physics, students will learn about
			distance and displacement and how they are used to describe the motion of
			objects. They will also learn about how to calculate distance and
			displacement using various formulas and how to use them to analyze the
			motion of objects. For example, students may learn about the relationship
			between distance, speed, and time and how to use this relationship to
			calculate the distance traveled by an object. They may also learn about
			how to use displacement to determine the final position of an object after
			it has moved a certain distance in a particular direction. Overall,
			understanding the concepts of distance and displacement is essential for
			analyzing and understanding the motion of objects in the physical world.

				Physics
			</h1>
			<div style={{ fontSize: "20px" }}>
				Physics is the study of the fundamental principles that govern the
				natural world. It is a broad field that encompasses a wide range of
				topics, including classical mechanics, electricity and magnetism,
				thermodynamics, and modern physics. In grade 11, students will begin to
				explore the fundamental concepts of physics, including motion, energy,
				and forces. They will learn about Newton{`'`}s laws of motion, which
				describe how objects move and behave under the influence of various
				forces. They will also study the principles of energy and work, and how
				they are related to one another.

				What Comes Next
			</h1>
			Once you’ve completed this course, you should feel comfortable with the
			building blocks of web programming but itching to dig deeper. Though we
			spend a fair bit of time digging into each of the major topics in this
			course, it’s really just a taste of what comes next (and all the cool
			stuff you can do with it). The last lesson of this course will give you an
			opportunity to choose between a Full Stack JavaScript and Full Stack Rails
			path, both of which are designed to take the foundation built in this
			course and build it into an applied understanding of the material. Each
			path will focus on taking these raw building blocks and honing them into a
			highly functional skillset. The Odin Project is maintained by
			professionals. We have chosen some of the best resources available and
			curated a guide on how to go through them. If there are no good resources,
			we write our own. With that said, know that everything in the curriculum
			is intentionally included and vital for you to become a successful
			programmer. As you move forward in the curriculum, each portion is built
			on everything that came before it, so skipping things will create pockets
			of non-understanding in your knowledge that start to affect your ability
			to solve problems and understand the task at hand. Additional resources
			are the only thing that is considered optional unless explicitly stated.
			These are here in case you feel like you need or want to dive deeper into
			a topic to get a better understanding. DO NOT SKIP ANYTHING! Additional
			Resources This section contains helpful links to related content. It isn’t
			required, so consider it supplemental. It looks like this lesson doesn’t
			have any additional resources yet. Help us expand this section by
			contributing to our curriculum.
